To add a file to the repository

creating and staging it for commit
1.touch filename.extension
2.vi - filename.extension	-- to edit it in vim(press esc :q! to quit && hold esc  :x to save made changes to file)
3.git add (filename.extension) or (.) -- to stage it for commit
4.now check whether it is being tracked or not by
 git status
5.git commit -m "comments to add"
----------------------------------

to clear the made commits 
1.git reset <commit id> --> id from which you want to remove the commits

-----------------------------------
Now if you want to make some changes to some files without commiting to them 
we can use a feature named as stashing --more like private version control

1.git stash	-- to stash the changes made in a file 
	(note: the made changes is stored in automatically created file)
2.git stash pop  -- to bring the made changes in the log
3. git stash clear -- to clear the made stash

-------------------------------------

Now to make changes in git repository

1.git remote add origin <url to the repository>

2.git remote -v  ---to know what changes are we authorized to made

3.git push origin master

         ^    ^    ^

 push - to push the made commits to the said repository
 origin - it indicates that we are making changes to the origin (in this case that is repository)
 master - at what branch you're ammending changes
